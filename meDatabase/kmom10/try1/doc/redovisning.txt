# Redovisning f√∂r try1-projektet

I have been working on the try1 folder, specifically on building a database using SQL. 
The goal of this project was to create a robust and efficient database to store and manage data.

To begin with, I designed the database schema, carefully considering the relationships 
between different entities and the data types for each attribute. I used SQL statements 
to create the necessary tables, specifying the primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

Next, I populated the database with relevant data. I wrote SQL insert statements to add 
records to the tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

To query the database, I utilized SQL select statements. I retrieved specific data based 
on various conditions, such as filtering by certain criteria or joining multiple tables together to extract meaningful insights.

The try1 project/exam involved building a robust and efficient database using SQL whcih can be accessed
and manipulated through the web app or the terminal client. I gained 
valuable experience in database design, data manipulation, and query optimization. This project 
has enhanced my understanding of database management and SQL programming.

Overall, the exam was challenging but manageable. It required careful consideration of the relationships 
between entities and the data types for each attribute. The process of designing the database schema and 
writing SQL statements took some time and effort. However, with proper planning and understanding of SQL 
concepts, it was possible to complete the exam successfully. The exam provided a good opportunity to apply 
the knowledge gained throughout the course and test database design and SQL programming skills. It was a 
reasonable examination that effectively assessed the understanding and proficiency in database management
and practicing on previous exams certainly helped a lot.



For each project requirement implemented in the try1 project, I carefully planned and executed the necessary 
steps to ensure a successful outcome.

Requirement 1: Building a robust and efficient database using SQL
To fulfill this requirement, I started by designing the database schema. I analyzed the data and identified 
the entities and their relationships. I then created the necessary tables using SQL statements, specifying 
primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. This process required attention to detail and a deep understanding 
of database design principles. I also reverse engineered the sql file to get a er diagram, a simple way to solve 
another requirement. I encountered some challenges in normalizing the data and ensuring data integrity, 
but with careful consideration and testing, I was able to overcome these obstacles.

Requirement 2: Implementing a search function
To meet this requirement, I leveraged my SQL skills to create a search function that allows users to query the 
database for specific information. I used SQL select statements with appropriate conditions and joins to retrieve 
the desired data. I also kept in mind that when searching I should NOT search in the developer table, but I should still display it.
I made a procedure in SQL that I call in a function in the exam.js file where all the functions are added.
I have a procedure for the web and another for the cli.js.
This task was relatively straightforward, as I had prior experience with SQL queries and knew how to structure them effectively.

Requirement 3: Implementing a report function
To fulfill this requirement, from what I understood, I took the table as it was wanted and printed it when it was required.
Had some eslint errors because it was more then 100 characters per line so i split it, might look a bit weired but all the info is there.
In retrospect, I probably should have parsed the data and loaded it into a sql database then selected the data with sql code and printed it,
not just making it a comment and printing it as is, but that ship has sailed.



Regarding the course, I found it to be highly informative and well-structured. The material provided a comprehensive 
overview of database management concepts and SQL programming. The guidance and support from the teachers were 
excellent, especially in the beginning when setting up the environemnts to program and with prompt responses to queries 
and helpful feedback on assignments. The course exercises and projects 
were challenging yet rewarding, allowing me to apply the knowledge gained and develop practical skills. 

In terms of improvement suggestions, it would be beneficial to include more hands-on exercises and real-world 
examples to further reinforce the concepts taught. Having more of the lessons in person would also help a lot, it felt
at times as though i was just following a long youtube tutorial. Additionally, providing more detailed explanations and 
step-by-step instructions for complex topics would be helpful for beginners. Overall, I am satisfied with the 
course and would highly recommend it to my friends and colleagues who are interested in learning about database 
management and SQL programming.

On a scale of 1-10, I would give this course a solid 8. It provided a solid foundation in database management 
and SQL programming, and the course material was well-presented and engaging although mostly online an not in person. 
The guidance and support from the teachers was much appreciated, and the practical projects allowed for the application 
of learned concepts. I am confident that the knowledge and skills gained from this course will be valuable in my future 
endeavors in software development.
